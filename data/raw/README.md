# Raw Data

This repository is a landing place for a limited amount of raw data entering the pipeline. Most of the workflow depends on data hosted in other APIs and pulled automatically. Occasionally files are emailed directly to us by our collaborators. To ensure these files are publicly available, they are enriched with metadata and posted here. These data might be accompanied by scripts in `../src/` that convert the original data from an unposted file in a proprietary format to one the ELT pipeline handles more easily.

These are files from the original sources with as little modification as possible. One major change is the conversion from Excel workbooks to CSV files. File are organized in subdirectories according to the source of the data.
