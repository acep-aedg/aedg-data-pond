            "description": "This lookup table cross references entities that report electricity sales to sources of electricity generation data: the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) and the State of Alaska's Power Cost Equalization (PCE) program. Sales information from PCE is generally community based; this is different from sales information from EIA, which is utility based. This is further complicated by the fact that several utilities (AVEC, AP&T, IPEC, and MKEC) own operations in multiple communities. A sales reporter unique identifier was created to combine data from these two sources and associate it with electrical grids. This table was manually created and extended with publicly available information.\n",
