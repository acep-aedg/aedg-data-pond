            "description": "This lookup table describes interties that connect electricity generation into grids to aggregate data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) and the State of Alaska's Power Cost Equalization (PCE) program. Each unique identifier of interties defines a geographic area and is time bound. In some cases, grids have expanded to provide service to nearby communities; in this case, the original intertie in this table has an end date, and a new intertie is created. When communities are connected, sometimes the powerhouse of one community is moved to standby mode or entirely new generation is added onto the grid. It also means that generation and sales reporting may change with the expansion. Some areas have particularly complicated reporting even though there is a single utility. For instance, Prince of Wales Island has multiple communities. Over the years, the grid that began in Craig has grown to intertie the other communities. Each of these communities reports to the PCE program separately despite the fact that generation sources are now shared. Additionally, there are multiple types and sources of generation, such as hydro and diesel, that are spread across the island. These generating units report differently to PCE versus EIA. This table was manually created and extended with publicly available information and used to derive the new table called `grids`.\n",
