Unless a utility/operator reports to the EIA, plants are not strictly identified. This makes it difficult to aggregate generation across a grid and/or the state. In this table, each plant is uniquely identified according to where the operator reports (PCE or EIA) and the intertie to which it provides power. This table was manually created by comparing the plant names, and extended with publicly available information.\n",
