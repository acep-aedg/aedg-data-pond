All sorts of entities operate power plants. EAch might be an electric utility, Independent Power Producer (IPPs), military base, industry such as a mine or a fish processing plant, or a state agency. Some report to the EIA, others to the PCE program, others to both, and other to neither. Operators that report for the PCE may have a Certificate of Public Convenience and Necessity (CPCN) from the Regulatory Commission of Alaska (RCA), but some operators may only report to the EIA and not have a CPCN. This new identifier provides a single frame of reference for all these cases.\n",
