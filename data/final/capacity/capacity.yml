  title: "Yearly Electrical Generation Capacity by Grid"
  summary: |
    This dataset is the electrical generation capacity, or nameplate capacity, of power plants summed over the grid for the most recent year available. It summarizes the maximum amount of electrical power that could be generated at any given time classified by fuels that would be used to generate it. This is a normalized table intended for internal use within the AEDG database.

    This dataset is the electrical generation capacity, or nameplate capacity, of power plants summed over the grid for the most recent year available. It summarizes the maximum amount of electrical power that could be generated at any given time classified by fuels that would be used to generate it. Two factors complicate this dataset. First, there is no single state or federal agency that collects data on all the generation sources in Alaska. Second, some communities have isolated microgrids where generation sources are easy to identify, but other communities are interconnected with interties into grids where generation sources are shared. In those cases, it is therefore impossible to pair a community with individual power stations (called plants) or the operators/utilities for which generation is recorded even if the plant is physically located within a community.
    To address the first issue, this dataset derives from the Alaska Energy Statistics workbooks, which in turn compiles data from multiple sources including community Power Cost Equalization reports collated by the Alaska Energy Authority and reporting to the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA). Source data was harmonized to account for differences in reporting through a combination of subject matter expertise and transformations.
    To address the second issue, capacity is summed over all the generators with different fuels - diesel and natural gas boilers, solar installations, wind turbines - that are connected to a grid. Grids were defined as an element of the Alaska Energy Statistics workbooks and implemented with a lookup table that joins them to individual plants. The same values for generation capacity will be reported for all the communities on a grid.

        Pulled data from the original sources, the compiled, corrected, harmonized, transformed data into Excel Workbooks as annual datasets and as Financial and Generation timeseries and as Infrastructure summaries.

        1. Contracted Neil McMahon to produce the Workbooks, and then posted them in GitHub for distribution.
        2. Extracted a the most recent capacity figures for each unique grid.
