Most communities in Alaska typically have an unmanned general aviation airport of which Alaska DOT P&F owns and operates 237 airports. This data is relatively static.\nAEDG uses these data to display transportation options because these greatly influence the prices paid for fuel and other energy sources. Communities who rely only on air freight will likely pay a much higher amount for energy.\n",
