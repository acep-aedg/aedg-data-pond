  description: | # Description of what this dataset is and what it is doing here
    Summary of the types of transportation available to each community. Includes information on airports, roads, the state ferry, harbors and docks, coastal status, and cargo barge. The price a community pays for energy depends significantly on the transportation options available for fuel and construction materials.
