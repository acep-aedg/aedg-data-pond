The workbooks were developed to provide community and utility level datasets that support regional and statewide aggregations for use in the 2024 Alaska Electricity Trends Report. This is a continuation of a 40+ year effort to create and maintain high level views of the state\u2019s energy profile that are useful for policy makers, businesses, researchers, and others interested in Alaska\u2019s energy sector. Data are derived from community Power Cost Equalization reports collated by the Alaska Energy Authority and power plant reporting to the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA). These sources are supplemented by annual filings to the Regulatory Commission of Alaska (RCA), village and powerhouse assessments, and direct communications with utilities and hydro/wind program managers.\nAdditional funding was contributed by Office of Naval Research (ONR) funded Alaska Regional Collaboration for Technology Innovation and Commercialization (ARCTIC) program, the Denali Commission, and the State of Alaska.\nAEDG uses this dataset as the best available compilation of electricity sales, incorporating data from multiple sources into a single source.\n",

Complied community names, locations, and FIPS identifiers for AEDG\n3. residential rates are pre-calculated as residential_rate for all reporting entities and post-subsidy effective_rate for PCE reporting entities\n4. data for commercial and industrial was reported only as sales and revenue. For these categories, rates were calculated by dividing revenue/sales_mwh, producing the columns industrial_rate_calculated and commercial_rate_calculated.\n5. For good measure, residential rates were also calculated this way. residential_rate pre-calculated in the Workbooks, should equal residential_rate_calculated, calculated by us. (spoiler: they are equal when rounded to 2 decimals, which I codified in a DBT data test)\n6. For a few non-PCE reporting entities, especially Railbelt utilities, neither residential rates nor effective rates were calculated. For this reason, I experimented with combining rates into a single column: starting with effective_rate and filling with residential_rate_calculated when effective_rate was NULL. I\u2019m not sure this is the best approach since they are different situations (non-PCE vs PCE), I suppose that\u2019s worth discussing. We could leave the two columns side by side in order to maintain clarity. Rails would need a smart query to pull calculated_rate when effective_rate was NULL, essentially making that column on the fly. For now, I left all 4 columns so we can look at this in detail.\n7. Joined sales data with AEDG communities to create this dataset\n",
