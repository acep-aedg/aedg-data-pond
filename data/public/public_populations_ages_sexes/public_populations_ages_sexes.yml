  description: | # Description of what this dataset is and what it is doing here
    Total populations were measured by the U. S. Census and associated with communities by the Alaska Division of Community and Regional Affairs (DCRA). This dataset includes population size by sex in Alaskan communities for the most recent 5-year American Community Survey (ACS) intervals. It also includes population by age. The 5-year interval data sets are published approximately 1/2 a period later than the End Year listed.

        1. Identified data source and integrated it into the data pipeline.
        2. Complied community names, locations, and FIPS identifiers for AEDG
        3. Joined population data with AEDG communities to create this dataset
