Note from DCRA on use for analysis: This data set mixes scale. It includes rows for boroughs, which contain multiple census designated places (CDP's) and cities from this same data set in many cases. This data has been visualized in a Geographic Information Systems (GIS) format and is provided as a service in the DCRA Information Portal by the Alaska Department of Commerce, Community, and Economic Development Division of Community and Regional Affairs (SOA DCCED DCRA), Research and Analysis section. SOA DCCED DCRA Research and Analysis is not the authoritative source for this data.\nAEDG includes tax data as a measure of economic activity. From our analysis, this tax data for \"All Locations\" includes records/rows for both individual cities and boroughs. The tax revenue values for a city are not included in the borough the city is geographically part of. For example, in 2023 the city of Fairbanks reported $4,279,586.00 in bed tax revenue but the Fairbanks North Star borough only reported $2,933,702.00 in bed tax revenue. When providing tax data for a borough as a geographic whole using this dataset, both the borough and any individual city listed separate from the borough but within the physical bounds of the borough will need to be aggregated.\n",
