# Public Data

This repository provides long-term public access to the data available via the AEDG's Data Explorer. These user-friendly versions are enriched with metadata and available to be applied to other purposes. These files are designed to face **external** users.

These are denormalized versions of the internal database tables - joined in ways to make the data more user friendly. These files are available via the Data Explorer portion of the AEDG. These files are accompanied by OEMetadata files that document the schema (i.e. data dictionary) and sources of the data.

Using these files, to answer questions such as "What is the electrical capacity of the grid that serves Ketchikan?", a user would download `public_capacity.csv` and filter to "Ketchikan" using their favorite tool.
