# Two notes on transportation
# 1. data model includes a column for "as of date", which is currently encoded in the metadata instead
# 2. boolean values are "t" and "f", which is weird. Change to "TRUE"/"FALSE"?

    Summary of the types of transportation available to each community.
  description: | # Description of what this dataset is and what it is doing here
    Summary of the types of transportation available to each community. Includes information on airports, roads, the state ferry, harbors and docks, coastal status, and cargo barge. The price a community pays for energy depends significantly on the transportation options available for fuel and construction materials.

        1. Identified data source and integrated it into the data pipeline.
        2. Complied community names, locations, and FIPS identifiers for AEDG
        3. Joined transportation data with AEDG communities to create this dataset
