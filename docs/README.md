# Documentation

## Additional Resources

The Alaska Energy Data Gateway (AEDG) team has written several Google Docs to support development of the system. Access to these documents is restricted to team members, though the hope is to make them public-facing eventually.

The following links are to requirements documentation created during the development of AEDG:

1. [20241202 - AEDG Requirements - dataset accessibility across the data management lifecycle](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ZFjkJt1KkI9LRuOfPbwjFfrgjr4qayG9n3q_UHJ4F4s/edit?usp=drive_link): The doc describes the meaning and justification of distributing intermediate datasets within the AEDG system.
2. [2025-05-19 Data Confidence Requirements](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1PiLv4rAmwp6NlhGbj-kEs9aMZ5f8_a02T36NWWILzlI/edit?usp=drive_link): This preliminary doc discusses a metric-based assessment of data sources that has been employed to identify sources that inspire the highest confidence.

The following links are to descriptions of possible future extensions to the datasets stored in the AEDG data pond:

1. [2025-06-24 To Update Energy Stats](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1CONjlOTThk9ndPJfZUKNOI4KHtJ0vCLXDmI0Q4KNybw/edit?usp=drive_link): AEDG depends critically on a series of Excel workbooks, [Alaska Energy Statistics, 2011 - 2021](https://acep-uaf.github.io/ak-energy-statistics-2011_2021/). Posting data for 2022 onward will require updates to these tables. This doc discusses issues that will need to be addressed to achieve this.
2. [Energy Data (besides Electricity)](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1bfCtU3Cq_sN4SZQFJbB8BM8HYkGNM1wIihU-KpYch1o/edit?usp=drive_link): AEDG data is heavily weighted towards the electricity sector. This doc discusses source of data on other forms of energy that are critical to Alaska such as natural gas and heating systems.
