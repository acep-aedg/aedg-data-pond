# How were the AEDG datasets made?


### Work with subject matter experts
First, we consulted with subject matter experts in order to determine which datasets were most relevant to our end users. These conversations led us to a wide range of data, including economics, demographics, utilities, labor, transportation, and education. 

### Source data sets
After our datasets were identified, we cataloged data server URLs for each dataset. We then wrote programming code in order to download all the data at the push of a button. A copy of the data was archived, then loaded into a database for processing.

### Data cleaning and verification
Before we could use the data, we needed to make sure it was clean and validated. Column names were standardized, values were calculated and converted, and data tests were written in order to ensure best available data.

### Combined / aggregated data sets
Once the data was cleaned and validated, we wrote code to subset, aggregate, and transform the tables into the datasets used in the Alaska Energy Data Gateway.
